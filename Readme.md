## Story

Your cousin's Dad is running an old computer shop and it's not doing very well. You just graduated from college with a major in computer science and a minor in business administration. You have an Australian cousin who's made a ton of money building datacenters. You figure you might as well spend the summer trying to help your cousin out and start a business with him and his Dad.
